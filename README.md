# adha-template-cda
The purpose of this repository is to contain FHIR implementation guide template styling that adds CDA specification branding (like logo), or other CDA artefact styling. 

It will directly inherit from the ADHA template `adha-template-base` (https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/adha-template-base) and is intended to serve as a base for most Agency CDA-style implementation guide publications.
