# au-digitalhealth-cda-template
The purpose of this repository is to contain FHIR implementation guide template styling that adds CDA specification branding (like logo). 

In future, the FHIR publication tooling may be used to assist with CDA specification development and this template will be required for the appropriate  CDA technology styling.
